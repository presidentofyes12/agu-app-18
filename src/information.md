## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
The DAO application consists of four main contracts:
- DAOToken: Handles token management and distribution
- LogicConstituent: Contains core business logic
- StateConstituent: Manages application state
- ViewConstituent: Provides read-only access to state

### Frontend Application
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and integrates with blockchain using ethers.js. Key features include:
- Real-time state synchronization
- Optimistic updates
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading state management

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Yarn or npm
- Access to Ethereum node (Infura or local)
- Etherscan API key (for contract verification)

### Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file with required configuration:
```env
NETWORK=mainnet
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
CHAIN_ID=1
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Deployment Steps
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Compile contracts:
```bash
yarn compile
```

3. Run deployment:
```bash
yarn deploy
```

4. Verify contracts (automatic on public networks):
```bash
yarn verify
```

### Post-Deployment
After deployment, update the frontend configuration with new contract addresses:
```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  DAO_TOKEN: '0x972Dc127cD4bbAfC87f885a554d8208113d768C6',
  LOGIC_CONSTITUENT: '0x5215bcD28f7A54E11F5A0ca3A687a679Ff69FeCC',
  STATE_CONSTITUENT: '0x98f345C539f67e8D6D5B7ceD4048b4Ee99307910',
  VIEW_CONSTITUENT: '0x8A2F613a31d6FdB9EEA3b6e6DD45959d832224FD',
  TRIPARTITE_PROXY: '0x64f0eD6D3f9bb53f0Aa6E614868E47710e9cbF85'
};
```

## Configuration

### Contract Configuration
Contracts can be configured through the deployment process using environment variables. Key configurations include:
- Gas price strategy
- Confirmation blocks
- Network selection

### Frontend Configuration
Frontend configuration is managed through environment variables and the config service:
- API endpoints
- Contract addresses
- Feature flags
- Performance tuning

## Monitoring

### Logging
The application uses a comprehensive logging system with multiple transports:
- Console output (development)
- File logging (production)
- Error tracking (Sentry)

Log levels:
- debug: Detailed debugging information
- info: General operational information
- warn: Warning messages for potential issues
- error: Error conditions requiring attention

### Metrics
Key metrics are tracked and can be monitored:
- Transaction success rate
- Gas usage patterns
- User interaction patterns
- Performance metrics

### Alerts
Alerts are configured for critical conditions:
- Contract errors
- High gas prices
- Unusual activity patterns
- System performance issues

## Development

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start local blockchain: `yarn chain`
4. Deploy contracts: `yarn deploy:local`
5. Start frontend: `yarn start`

### Testing
- Unit tests: `yarn test`
- Integration tests: `yarn test:integration`
- End-to-end tests: `yarn test:e2e`

### Code Quality
- Linting: `yarn lint`
- Type checking: `yarn type-check`
- Format code: `yarn format`

### Contributing
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make changes
3. Run tests and linting
4. Submit pull request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Transaction Failures
   - Check gas price settings
   - Verify account balance
   - Check network congestion

2. State Synchronization Issues
   - Clear local cache
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify contract addresses

3. Performance Issues
   - Monitor batch sizes
   - Check cache settings
   - Verify network latency

### Support
For technical support:
1. Check documentation
2. Review Github issues
3. Contact development team

## Security

### Best Practices
1. Private Key Management
   - Use environment variables
   - Never commit private keys
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. Access Control
   - Implement role-based access
   - Regular permission audits
   - Secure key storage

3. Contract Security
   - Regular audits
   - Automated testing
   - Upgrade planning

This documentation is regularly updated as the application evolves.
